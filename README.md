# 🎇 GraphQL Learning Playground
**🎆 My progress while learning GraphQL**

#### 🥚 Ex 1 - Hello Mum 
```null
  ✅ Query
```

#### 🐣 Ex 2 - Hello World!
```null
  ✅ Query
  ✅ Folders Organized
```

#### 🐣 Ex 3 - Hmm, I think I got it
```null
  ✅ Query & Mutation ( create, delete )
  ✅ Typed Input & Input handle
  ✅ Folders Organized
```

#### 🐤 Ex 4 - Actually, there's a more lot to learn
```null
  ✅ Query & Mutation ( full crud )
  ✅ Typed Input & Input handle
  ✅ Folders Organized
  ✅ Context 
```

#### 🐥 Ex 5 - I'll get there eventually
*Practice only - creating fully relational crud with mongoose* 
```null
  ✅ Query & Mutation ( full crud )
  ✅ Typed Input & Input handle
  ✅ Folders Organized
  ✅ Context ( Auth )
  ✅ Online DB ( MongoDB )
```

#### 🐔 Ex 6 - Now I understand graphQL on back-end!
*Abbandoned subscription, cause it was boring. Sowy*
```null
  ✅ Query, Mutation
  ✅ Typescript
  ...
```


### 🤩 Time to move to front-end! 
*😞Unfortunately I'll not be releasing the ReactJS project here, this repo would be a total mess*
